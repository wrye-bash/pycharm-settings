## Wrye Bash - PyCharm Settings
This repository contains PyCharm settings (i.e. the `.idea` folder) to
be used for Wrye Bash.

To use, clone it as the `.idea` folder into your `wrye-bash` clone:
```shell
$ pwd
/e/Infernio/Desktop/Programming/wrye-bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wrye-bash/pycharm-settings.git .idea
```
Note that you'll have to remove your .idea folder first so that git can
cleanly clone into it. It's best to just do this right after cloning
the main repository, before ever launching PyCharm.
